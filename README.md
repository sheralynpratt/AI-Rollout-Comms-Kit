# AI Rollout Comms Kit  
**Clear open-source communication tools for successful AI adoption.**  

## Why This Exists  
Most organizations are investing in AI, but many struggle to get value because their people:  
- Don’t understand what the AI tool does
- Fear being replaced or monitored
- Tune out jargon-filled announcements

**Result:** Wasted money, stalled adoption, and lost trust.  

This kit provides **ready-to-use communication templates and clarity tools** so leaders can roll out AI projects with confidence.  

## What’s Inside  

### `/templates`  
- **AI_Rollout_Email.md** → announce AI adoption clearly, without jargon.
- **FAQ_Template.md** → answer common employee fears.
- **Slide_Deck_Outline.md** → 10-slide structure for leadership briefings.

### `/examples`  
- **Before_After_Rewrites.md** → side-by-side rewrites: *“Before (confusing)” → “After (clear).”*  
- Shows how small shifts in language build trust.  

### `/tools`

**Clarity_Checker_basic.py**  
A simple, zero-dependency Python tool that evaluates how clear your AI rollout communication is.

**How to Run It:**
