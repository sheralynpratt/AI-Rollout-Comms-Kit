# AI Rollout Comms Kit

## Why This Exists  
Most organizations are investing in AI, but many struggle to get value because their people:

**Result:** Wasted money, stalled adoption, and lost trust.  

This kit provides **ready-to-use communication templates and clarity tools** so leaders can roll out AI projects with confidence.

### `/examples`

- Shows how small shifts in language build trust.
