# AI Rollout Comms Kit
**Open-source templates and tools for clear, human AI adoption.**

---

## Why This Exists
Most organizations are investing in AI, but many fail to get value because people:

- Don’t understand what the tool does.
- Fear being replaced or monitored.
- Tune out jargon-filled announcements.

**Result:** Wasted money, stalled adoption, and lost trust.

This kit provides **ready-to-use communication templates and clarity tools** so leaders can roll out AI projects with confidence — and employees can adopt them with less fear and more clarity.

## What’s Inside

### `/templates`
- **AI_Rollout_Email.md** → clear, friendly announcement email that avoids jargon and “training” dread.
- **FAQ_Template.md** → answers the questions employees are really asking (not just what leaders wish they would).
- **Slide_Deck_Outline.md** → 10-slide structure for leadership briefings, with space for **directional presenter notes** so leaders know what to say, not just what to show.

### `/examples`
- **Before_After_Rewrites.md** → side-by-side rewrites: “Before (confusing)” → “After (clear).”
- Includes fill-in-the-blank sections for specific examples (e.g., “We’ll begin learning about [tool] on [day/month].”), so communicators can plug in details fast.
- Shows how small shifts in tone and specificity build trust and reduce anxiety.

### `/tools`

**Clarity_Checker_basic.py**  
A simple, zero-dependency Python script that evaluates how clear your AI rollout communication is.

**Features:**
- Scores clarity on a 0–100 scale.
- Labels output as **Very clear**, **Fairly clear**, or **Needs work**.
- Flags common corporate jargon (e.g., leverage, optimize, synergy).
- Suggests more human alternatives.
- Works with no external installs — just Python.

**How to Run It:**
cd AI-Rollout-Comms-Kit/tools
python Clarity_Checker_basic.py input.txt

## Who This Is For
- **Leaders** announcing AI adoption.
- **L&D teams** introducing new tools.
- **Change managers** facing resistance.
- **Comms pros** tasked with “making AI sound simple.”

## How to Use
1. Browse `/templates` and adapt them to your organization.
2. Use `/examples` to train your ear for clarity by comparing before/after rewrites.
3. Run `/tools/Clarity_Checker_basic.py` to scan your own drafts for jargon and clarity.
4. Add specifics: tie AI adoption to familiar company processes and guardrails (e.g., “Your data remains secure — the AI uses the same approved company data under our strict privacy standards.”).
5. Encourage feedback loops: invite employees to flag what doesn’t make sense so you can improve adoption for everyone.

## Why It Matters
AI adoption isn’t just about tools — it’s about trust.  
By using human, specific, and non-jargon language, organizations can:
- Reduce fear.
- Increase adoption speed.
- Build long-term confidence in AI projects.
